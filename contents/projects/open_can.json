    "description":"The project was a conceptual campaign on a topic set by the RSA – in this case to highlight the advantages of the humble tin can and other metal packaging. After conducting extensive research into the topic, the design solution was a multichannel campaign with ambient as the main channel. The campaign’s aim was to educate about and encourage the use of metal cans due to their advantages in key areas like sustainability, convenience, reliability and nutrition.",
